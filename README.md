# Christmas Invasion

My project is based on oldschool Space Invaders with a Christmas twist :christmas_tree: :gift: :alien:

## Introduction

This is the first project of Ironhack. I had to create a game with DOM manipulation and/or canvas that worked on a browser. I had a really fun time discovering how it all works.

## How I got to the final project

Initially it was supposed to be a firefighter game, but given the time of the year I am at, I thought it would be funny to have a Christmas themed invaders game.

## Challenges

Organizing the code and making it work.
